# TestIntuition
Exercise for Intution

I don't like to have several interfaces or classes in the same file but I put all the related classes and interfaces for each question
of the exercise are in the same file for reading and easy undestanding porpouses.


I choosed to do in a console application because wasn't given requeriments about how to do. If you need more information or clarification,
please, let me know.

The first question related to "Employees" is in the file "Employee.cs".
The second question related to modification of the if and else is in the file "Vehicle.cs".
The third question related to improving the given code is in the file "CartTotal.cs".


Thanks.
